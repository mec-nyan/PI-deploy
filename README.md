# Proyecto Individual: Videogames

## Deploy and mobile

<hr />

This is a modified version of my original Individual Project at <b>Henry</b>'s.

It's been modified so it can be deployed to <b>Heroku</b> (backend) and <b>Firebase</b> (frontend).

Also, the original project wasn't responsive at all (*the project was develop in a short period of time and the responsivity was not a priority then*), I have changed that is this version of the app. Yet I reckon to be really responsive it has to be heavily refactored to accomplish a mobile first design.
